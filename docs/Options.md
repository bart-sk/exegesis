## controllers

Controllers are functions that Exegesis executes to handle incoming requests.
You can read about controllers
[here](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Exegesis%20Controllers.md).

The `controllers` option tells Exegesis how to find controller functions to
call.  This can either be the name of a folder containing controller modules,
or it can be a hash where keys are controller names.  If it is a folder,
you can additionally specified `controllersPattern`, which is a glob pattern
telling Exegesis which files to load.

For example, suppose you have a folder in your project named "src/controllers",
which contains "Pets.js" and "Users.ts".  If you're loading your OpenAPI
document in "/src/index.js", you could specify `controllers`
as:

```js
import * as path from 'path';
{
    controllers: path.resolve(__dirname, 'controllers'),
    controllersPattern: "**/*.@(ts|js)"
```

Then you can use [`x-exegesis-controller: Pets`](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/OAS3%20Specification%20Extensions.md)
in your OpenAPI document to reference the "Pets.js" module, and use either
`operationId` or `x-exegesis-operationId` to reference a function within the
module.

## allowMissingControllers

If false, then if any operations do not define a controller, Exegesis will raise
an error when the API is being compiled.  If true, then Exegesis will simply
pretend any operations that don't have a controller do not exist, and will not
handle them.

Defaults to true.

## authenticators

An hash of authenticators.  Keys are security scheme names from your
OpenAPI document, values are authenticator functions.  See [OAS3 Security](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/OAS3%20Security.md)
for details.

## mimeTypeParsers

A hash where keys are either mime types or mimetype wildcards (e.g. 'text/*'),
and values are parsers.

This option is used to control how Exegesis parses message bodies and certain
parameters.  By default, parsers are provided for 'text/*', and
'application/json', however you can override either of these.

OpenAPI 3.x defines special handling for 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
and Exegseis will automatically generate an appropriate parser for this content,
however you can override the built-in implementation by supplying your own
parser for this media type.

A parser is either an object of the form:

```js
{
    /**
     * Synchronous function which parses a string.  A BodyParser must implement
     * this function to be used for parameter parsing.
     *
     * @param {string} encoded - The encoded value to parse.
     * @returns - The decoded value.
     */
    parseString(encoded) {...}
}
```

Or:

```js
{
    /**
     * Async function which parses an incoming HTTP request.  This is essentially
     * here so you can use express/connect body parsers.
     *
     * @param {http.IncomingMessage} req - The request to read.  This function
     *   should add `req.body` after parsing the body.  If `req.body` is already
     *   present, this function can ignore the body and just call `next()`.
     * @param {http.ServerResponse} res - The response object.  Well behaved
     *   body parsers should *not* write anything to the response or modify it
     *   in any way.
     * @param next - Callback to call when complete.  If no value is returned
     *   via the callback then `req.body` will be used as the body.
     */
    parseReq(req, res, next) {...}
}
```

In order to be used for parsing parameters, a parser must implement
`parseString()`.  A parser that does not implement `parseReq()` can
still be used for parsing request bodies.

## defaultMaxBodySize

If a `MimeTypeParser` provided in `mimeTypeParsers` does not support
`parseReq()`, this defines the maximum size (in bytes) of a body that will be parsed.
Bodies longer than this will result in a "413 - Payload Too Large" error.
Built in body parsers will also respect this option.

## customFormats

If you use the "format" specifier in your OpenAPI document with custom defined
formats, you must provide validation functions for each format used.

`customFormats` is a hash where keys are format names.  Values can be one of:

- A RegExp for checking a string.
- A `function(string) : boolean` for checking a string, which returns
  false the the string is invalid.
- A `{validate, type}` object, where `type` is either "string" or "number",
  and validate is a `function(string) : boolean`.

## ignoreServers

OpenAPI 3.x lets you specify what servers your API is available on.  For example:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: '/api/v2'
```

By default, exegesis will take 'servers' into account when routing requests,
so if you have the above servers section, and a path in your API called
"/users", then exegesis will only match the route if the incoming requests has
the URL "/api/v2/users".

If you have path templates in your servers, the variables will be available to
your controllers via `context.params.server`.

If you specify the `ignoreServers` option, however, exegesis will ignore the
servers section, an route purely based on your paths.

## autoHandleHttpErrors

By default, ExegesisRunner will turn `exegesis.HttpError`s (such as errors
generated from `context.makeError()`, `exegesis.ValidationError`s, or any error
with a `.status` into JSON replies with appropriate error messages.  If you want
to handle these errors yourself, set this value to false, alternatively set the value
to a `function(err)` function that handles the error returning a `HttpResult` object.
See [customErrorHandler](../test/integration/customErrorHandler.ts) for an example.

Note that all `HttpError`s will have a `.status` property with a suggested
numeric HTTP response code.

## onResponseValidationError

This is a function to call when response validation fails.  If you provide this
function, Exegesis will validate the responses that controllers generate before
they are sent to the client.  If you throw an exception in this function,  a
500 error will be generated and the reply will not be sent.

Note that when bodies are strings, buffers, or streams, Exegesis will not try
to parse your body to see if it conforms to the response schema; only JSON
objects are validated.

If provided, this should be a `function(result)` function, where:

- `result.errors` is a list of validation errors.  Validation errors
  are `{type, message, location: {in: 'response', name: 'body', docPath}}` objects.
- (for OAS3) `result.isDefault` is true if we validated against a 'default' status code.
- `result.context` is the context passed to the controller.

## validateDefaultResponses

Controls how Exegesis validates responses.  If this is set to false, then in
OAS3 Exegesis will not do validation for responses unless the response status
code matches an explicit status code in the responses object (not the "default"
status code).  If this is set to true, then all responses will be validated.

This option is ignored if `onResponseValidationError` is not set.  If
`onResponseValidationError` is set, the default is true.

## allErrors

If set, then when encountering a validation error Exegesis will return
all errors found in the document, instead of just the first error.  This
causes Exegesis to spend more time on requests with errors in them, so
for performance reasons this is disabled by default.

## uploadDir

If set, then default upload directory will be set in `MultiPartFormParser` (formidable)

## maxFileSize

If set, then default file size will be chnaged in `MultiPartFormParser` (formidable)
